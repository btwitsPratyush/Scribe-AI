   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Or run both together:**

   npm run dev:all
   ```

4. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:3000/recording`

5. **Click:**
   - "Start Mic" - Record from microphone
   - "Start Tab" - Record from browser tab
   - "Tab + Mic" - Record both simultaneously ⭐

## 📝 Notes

- Make sure `.env.local` has:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL="http://localhost:3001"
  SOCKET_PORT=3001
  GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"
  DATABASE_URL="your-db-url"
  ```

- The Socket.io server must be running on port 3001
- Network requests will show in DevTools Network tab
- WebSocket connections show in DevTools Network > WS filter

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you see "Connecting to server...":
1. Check if Socket.io server is running: `npm run start-socket-server`
2. Verify port 3001 is not blocked
3. Check `.env.local` has correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL`

If buttons don't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're logged in
3. Check Socket.io connection status
